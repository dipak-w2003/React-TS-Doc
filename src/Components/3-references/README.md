## 1. Optimization with `useMemo` & `useCallback`

### Explanation:

Use `useMemo` to memoize expensive computations and avoid recalculating values on every render. `useCallback` helps memoize functions so they don't get recreated on every render, optimizing performance in certain scenarios, such as when passing callbacks down to child components.

---

## 2. Lazy Loading in React with `React.lazy()` & `Suspense`

### Explanation:

`React.lazy()` allows you to dynamically import components only when they are needed, reducing the initial load time of your application. Use `Suspense` to display fallback content while the lazy-loaded component is being loaded.

---

## 3. State Management in React with Redux & Redux Toolkit

### Explanation:

Redux is a state management library, and Redux Toolkit simplifies common Redux patterns. This section covers how to set up Redux in a TypeScript environment, including reducers, actions, and slices.

---

## 4. TypeScript in React: Best Practices

### Explanation:

In this section, you'll learn how to use TypeScript effectively with React. Topics include typing props, state, and functions, and working with hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext` in a type-safe manner.

---

## 5. React Performance Profiling

### Explanation:

Use React Developer Tools to profile your components and identify performance bottlenecks. Learn how to use the "Why did this render?" feature to optimize rendering and prevent unnecessary re-renders.

---

## 6. React Router: Dynamic Routing with TypeScript

### Explanation:

This section covers setting up dynamic routes with React Router in a TypeScript project. It includes type-safe navigation, dynamic route parameters, and nested routes.

---

## 7. Handling Forms in React with `Formik` & `Yup`

### Explanation:

Learn how to use `Formik` for handling form state, validation, and submission. Combine it with `Yup` for declarative form validation, improving both developer experience and code quality.

---

## 8. Custom Hooks for Code Reusability

### Explanation:

Custom hooks allow you to reuse logic across different components. This section covers how to create reusable hooks for tasks like data fetching, form management, or managing local storage.

---

## 9. Using Context API vs Redux for Global State Management

### Explanation:

Understand the differences between the React Context API and Redux. Learn when to use Context for simpler state management and when Redux is necessary for handling more complex global state.

---

## 10. Error Boundaries in React

### Explanation:

Implement error boundaries to handle JavaScript errors in child components and show a fallback UI instead of crashing the whole app. Learn how to create reusable error boundary components.

---

## 11. Handling Asynchronous Data Fetching with `useEffect`

### Explanation:

Learn how to fetch data from APIs using the `useEffect` hook and handle loading, error, and success states. This section includes best practices for handling async logic in React.

---

## 12. React Testing with `Jest` & `React Testing Library`

### Explanation:

Learn how to write tests for your React components using `Jest` and `React Testing Library`. Topics include unit tests, mocking API calls, and testing user interactions.

---

## 13. Styling React Components with `Styled-components`

### Explanation:

`Styled-components` enables you to write component-scoped CSS in JavaScript. This section explains how to use it to style React components, pass props to styles, and create dynamic themes.

---

## 14. Component Composition in React

### Explanation:

Component composition allows you to create flexible and reusable components. This section discusses patterns like Higher-Order Components (HOCs) and Render Props to enhance component reusability.

---

## 15. Code Splitting and Bundle Optimization

### Explanation:

Learn how to optimize your app’s bundle size through techniques like code splitting, dynamic imports, and using Vite's built-in optimization features to reduce loading times and improve performance.

---

## 16. Using Web Workers in React

### Explanation:

Web workers let you run scripts in the background, separate from the main thread. This section explores how to offload intensive computations to web workers, improving your app’s performance.

---

## 17. Internationalization (i18n) in React with `react-i18next`

### Explanation:

Learn how to set up internationalization in React using `react-i18next`. This section covers managing translations, detecting the user's language, and dynamically switching between languages.

---

## 18. Form Validation with `React Hook Form` & `Yup`

### Explanation:

`React Hook Form` provides an easy-to-use API for handling forms, while `Yup` offers schema-based validation. This section teaches how to integrate these libraries for efficient form handling and validation.

---

## 19. Progressive Web Apps (PWA) in React

### Explanation:

This section covers how to turn your React app into a Progressive Web App (PWA), enabling offline functionality, installation on mobile devices, and improved performance using service workers.

---

## 20. SSR (Server-Side Rendering) with React and Vite

### Explanation:

Learn how to implement server-side rendering (SSR) in your React app with Vite, which improves SEO and reduces load times by rendering pages on the server before sending them to the client.
